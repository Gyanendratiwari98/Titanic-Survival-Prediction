# Titanic Survival Prediction – Logistic Regression 🛳️

This project applies Logistic Regression to predict survival outcomes on the Titanic dataset.

## 📊 Objective
Build a classification model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using:
- Gender
- Passenger class
- Age
- Embarkation port
- Other features

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Logistic Regression (Binary Classification )
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Categorical Encoding
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall)

## 📁 Dataset
Kaggle Titanic Dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

Use the `train.csv` file to build the model.

## 🔍 Key Steps
- Data Cleaning
- EDA
- Handling Missing Values
- Encoding Categorical Variables
- Training Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation

## 📈 Final Accuracy
Achieved model accuracy around ~78% using basic logistic regression (no hyperparameter tuning).

## 🧪 Future Work
- Try other classifiers (Random Forest, SVM)
- Apply cross-validation
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
